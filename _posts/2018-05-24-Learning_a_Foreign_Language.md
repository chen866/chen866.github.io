As globalisation becomes the increasingly dominant worldwide trend, learning a new language is becoming ever more important. By learning a foreign language, there are many benefits to be gained; such as an increased chance of gaining employment in transnational corporations and self convenience when you are travelling overseas. However, there are some disadvantages too; for example, it costs a lot of money and effort to learn a language, but you may not get satisfactory results. But despite all the arguments about whether learning a foreign language is beneficial, there is no doubt that it is becoming one of the important skills one must acquire in order to survive in the modern age.

> 随着全球化日益成为全球趋势的主流，学习新语言变得越来越重要。通过学习外语，可以获得很多好处;如跨国公司就业机会增加，以及出国旅游时的自我便利。但是，也有一些缺点;例如，学习一门语言需要花费大量金钱和精力，但是可能无法获得满意的结果。但是，尽管所有关于学习外语是否有益的论点，毫无疑问，它正在成为现代人为了生存而必须获得的重要技能之一。

Firstly, learning a foreign language can bring a lot of advantages. The most important one is that it can add significantly to your resume. In an age when internet and I-phones rule the world, communication between different countries is just as easy as talking to your next door neighbour. But what if the people from these two countries cannot understand each other because they speak a different language? This is where knowing a foreign language becomes handy. It can solve not only your personal communication issues but can also help you gain a career in the translating industry, or perhaps entering a transnational company. Learning about different cultures and languages can also enrich our own understanding of the world and the other people that live in it. Thus, learning a new language has cultural significances and can improve one’s future prospect.

> 首先，学习外语可以带来很多好处。最重要的是它可以显着增加您的简历。在互联网和智能手机统治世界的时代，不同国家之间的交流就像谈论你的邻居一样简单。但如果这两个国家的人因为说不同的语言而不能相互理解呢？这是知道外语变得方便的地方。它不仅可以解决您的个人沟通问题，还可以帮助您在翻译行业中获得职业生涯，或者可能进入跨国公司。了解不同的文化和语言也可以丰富我们对世界和生活在其中的其他人的理解。因此，学习一门新语言具有文化意义，可以改善未来的前景。

On the other hand, there are also disadvantages to learning a new language. It costs a lot of time and effort to try to learn a new language; now you need to ask yourself, is it worth it? It turns out that it is very difficult to learn a foreign language well if you are not living in that country. For example, it is not like that you can speak fantastic French if you have never been to a French-speaking country. A lot of the times, a language is based on habits rather than the rules of grammar. And you cannot acquire that habit if you do not live in that certain community in that certain country. Thus it is very difficult to learn a foreign language well on your own, and it may take up an amount of your time and money that is disproportionate to its benefits.

> 另一方面，学习一种新语言也有缺点。尝试学习一种新语言需要花费大量的时间和精力;现在你需要问自己，这是否值得？事实证明，如果你不住在那个国家，学习外语非常困难。例如，如果你从来没有去过讲法语的国家，那么你就不会说法语很棒的法语。很多时候，一种语言是基于习惯而不是语法规则的。如果你不住在那个特定国家的某个社区，你就无法获得这种习惯。因此，你自己学习一门外语是非常困难的，它可能占用你的时间和金钱，这与你的好处不成比例。

In conclusion, learning a foreign language has two sides to it. It may improve your employment prospects and enrich your cultural understandings; but may also cost a lot of money, time and effort. However, whatever the argument on whether it is good to learn a foreign language; there is no doubt that it had become a very important part of the education and training of the modern age

> 总之，学习外语有两方面的含义。它可以改善你的就业前景，丰富你的文化理解;但也可能花费大量金钱，时间和精力。但是，无论有关学习外语是否好的争论，毫无疑问，它已经成为现代教育和培训的一个非常重要的组成部分。
